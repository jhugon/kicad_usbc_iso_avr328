# KiCad USB-C isolated ATmega328

A USB-C to serial converter connected through opto-isolators to an ATmega328.
Power for the isolated side comes through another USB-C port.

All runs on the 4V DC that comes through the USB ports and everything is
through-hole.

Notable parts are the USB-serial converter, a MCP2221A-I/P, the isolators,
ACPL-772L-000E, and the microcontroller, ATmega328P-PU.
